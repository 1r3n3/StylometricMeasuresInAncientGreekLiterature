# Best Stylometric Measures in Ancient Greek Literature by Irene Martin

This project is based on the paper  [“The Un-Platonic Menexenus: A Stylometric Analysis with more Data”](https://github.com/ThomasK81/PlatoStylometricAnalysis/blob/master/GRBS_Version.pdf) by [Dr. Thomas Koentges](https://github.com/ThomasK81), which is the biggest stylometric experiment for Ancient Greek to date.       


## The idea behind this project

In Koentges’ paper, R-based stylometric measures (i.e. Burrows Delta, Eder’s Simple, Eder’s Delta and Cosine Delta) were investigated regarding their K-Score (a measure Koentges devised). It was shown that the measure Eder’s Simple performed more reliably than the more widely used Eder’s Delta, Cosine Delta and Burrows Delta. While the measure Cosine Delta has proven to work best for English, German and French, Eder developed his measures with more morphologically complex languages in mind (himself being a Latinist). 
Of all existing stylometry measures, Burrows Delta, Eder’s Simple, Eder’s Delta and Cosine Delta will be used for the experiment series because they have shown good results in Koentges’ research.    

The main focus of Koentges’ paper is the question of authenticity of the Menexenus and Koentges only suggests in a footnote: “To confirm Eder’s Simple as the best measure currently available for Ancient Greek works, this study should be followed up by a stylometric experiment based solely on works where we are 100% certain of authorship to get an understanding which method performs better in a more controlled sample than in a real-world data-set.”    
My research is motivated by this quotation and thus the experiments in this work will examine the measure’s research reputation and domain specific effects for the computational research of Ancient Greek.
